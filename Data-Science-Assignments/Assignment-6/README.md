# 📊 Assignment 6 — Hypothesis Testing  
**Author:** Athul N A  
**Platform:** Google Colab  

This assignment focuses on one of the most important concepts in statistics and data-driven decision making — **Hypothesis Testing**.  
The notebook demonstrates how to test assumptions using real-world data, interpret statistical evidence, and draw meaningful conclusions.

- **Paired t-test**  
- Assumptions (normality, equal variance, independence)

### 🔹 3. Non-Parametric Tests (if included)
- Mann–Whitney U test  
- Wilcoxon test  
- When and why to use non-parametric tests

### 🔹 4. Exploratory Data Checks
- Identifying distributions  
- Checking normality (histograms, boxplots, Q-Q plots)  
- Understanding variance differences  

### 🔹 5. Practical Scenarios
The notebook likely includes hypothesis tests such as:
